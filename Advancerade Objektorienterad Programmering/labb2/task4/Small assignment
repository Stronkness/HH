Framework is basically a form of structure with how to structure up where everything will be.
Like where everything should be put in the GUI and where everything is put.

What classes are part of the framework?
- Presenter & ImagePresenter

What does the application programmer need to do to write a complete application?
- If it's a application the programmer need to know where to position everything correctly so the for example the buttons
and the images doesn't look too crooked or that they for some reason staple on each other. As a application need to look
rather good an smooth in the GUI which is a big part of the application. But exactly WHAT the programmer need to write is a 
question of what kind of application it will be. But if we follow this example in the link we got to this task
is that we need to create some form of textfield and imagefield with buttons placed in north, south, east and west
so we can control what happends in the application, in this task its a presenter which will slide through pictures and
print out the text associated to the picture. So basically the programmer need to know how to control what the buttons have 
to do and where they should be placed, and also where the textfield and imagefield should be placed and how they will work 
with the specified application. Also how showText and showImage will be used to the textfield and the imagefield.


TASK 10
What classes did YOU define to specialize the framework?
- Menu
- ImageComponent
- textcomponent
- display

Menu is the main in the program. ImageComponent basically creates the image and paints it on the display. Textcomponent does the same as ImageComponent 
but works instead with the JTextField with the display, it takes the text out of the textfile and inserts it in the arraylist at a designated position.
Display is the place where the display is created and where everything happends to the display.

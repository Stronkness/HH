# FRAKMusic
This is a project in Algorithm and Data Structures
there we chose to make a music player.
We will divide this project in small pieces 
to make the project more efficient, then we can take a
task and make it work in that way its meant to be.
This music player is going to have a interface to 
interact with a pleasant experience. Thanks for 
reading this and hope you appreciate our music player.

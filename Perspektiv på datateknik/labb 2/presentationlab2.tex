\frametitle{Introduction}
The goal with this laboratory exercise was to learn how to make functions and matrices. 
\newline

The exercise was mostly about doing various operations, such as calculating the area of an triangle and measuring the perimeter and the variance. 
\newline

Another goal with this laboratory exercise was to learn how to generate an specific error message in MATLAB.
\newline

In this lab the task is to create scripts for calcTriAra (task 1) and a program calculating the variance of a matrix (task 2).

\frametitle{Scripts for the Tasks}
The scripts for the tasks are in the MATLAB files. 

\newline
For more information about the script and how it works, check those files.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
As both scripts worked perfectly the tasks have been accomplished and we got a good result. 
\newline

The two scripts are published in the .zip file for further investigation for the one who wants to.
